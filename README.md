This project aimed to create a convolutional neural network capable of identifying plant types and the state of the plant i.e. its accompanying affliction if any which may negatively impact its product yield.

Using dense net neural network architecture, we can get high accuracy and confidence. After training the model with training dataset and with validation dataset for 50-100 epochs until level of accuracy was to be 
deemed satisfactory. Our implementation producing overall accuracy of 92.%. 

Although the DenseNet model requires lots of parameters with increased memory usage, it can also be argued that due to the presence of skip connections the model can avoid relearning similar features over and over 
resulting in improved parameter training speed and efficiency.
